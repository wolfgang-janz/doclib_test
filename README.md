# Der BergdoktorBot – A Doctolib doctor's appointment Telegram notifier

![Der BergdoktorBot banner](images/Der_Bergdoktor_banner_with_working_title_and_project_description.jpg)

Get Telegram notifications about the most recent doctor's appointments on [doctolib.de](https://www.doctolib.de/). This script will notify you **every minute** as long as appointments exist within the next `UPCOMING_DAYS`. The next appointment outside of that threshold is additionally notified **on the hour**.

ℹ️ 🔒 🔧 Remember that this static script does not know anything about your doctolib details behind your login so you have to **monitor** and **adjust** it on the go to reduce unwanted notifications.

## Setup

### Telegram

The setup follows these [instructions](https://sarafian.github.io/low-code/2020/03/24/create-private-telegram-chatbot.html). For simplicity I tried to compress it even more in the following step by step list:

1. **Create** a Telegram bot using [@botfather](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@BotFather) ([FAQ](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq)).
   - Username: `@<NAME>Bot`
   - Disable `Allow Groups?`
   - Turn on `Group Privacy`
   
   The bot `Token` will be available once the bot is created.
   <br>Write it down, you'll need it in a later step.
2. **Create** a **private** group. Overyone in the group will see the messages from your bot.
   - Group name: `MyPrivateGroup`
   - Group Type: `private`
   
   Warning: **Do not** edit special permissions for users as this will [convert the group into a supergroup](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62291433) which **does not work** with this code.
3. Temporarily **enable** `Allow Groups?` on the bot.
4. **Add** the bot to the group.
5. Immediately **deactivate** `Allow Groups?` on the bot after adding it to the group.
6. **Post** a test message into the group via the app or the browser (required to get the next step running).
   Start message with `/` in order for the bot to be able to read it (`Group Privacy` is turned on by default).
7. **Retrieve** group `chat_id` by visiting `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in the browser.
   <br>Write it down, you'll need it in a later step.
8. Let the bot **send** a test message via visiting `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage?chat_id=<GROUP_CHAT_ID>&text=Test` in the browser.
   <br>The message should appear in the group chat.

### Script

1. Insert the bot `Token` into the constant `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
1. Insert the `chat_id` into the constant `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

You do **not** have to be signed in to doctolib.de in order to do do the next steps that will get your search query.

1. Navigate to [doctolib.de](https://www.doctolib.de/)
2. Use the search mask to find a doctor you want to make an appointment at and hit `search`
3. Once your on the doctor's landing page open your browsers `dev tools`, select the `Network` tab and leave it open for the next steps
4. Click on `TERMIN BUCHEN`
5. Answer the following questions in the appointment wizard until you reach the date overview that says `Wählen Sie das Datum für den Termin`
6. Copy the **URL of the browser** into the constant `BOOKING_URL`
6. Select the filter `Fetch/XHR` within the `Network` tab in order to make it easier to find the correct request URL
7. Look for a request to `availabilities.json…` and click on it in the list of requests
8. Copy the value of the `Request URL` in the detail view and paste it into the constant `AVAILABILITIES_URL`

### Cron

First of all the script has to be made executable.

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/notifyDoctolibDoctorsAppointment.py
```

Next, schedule the script execution via the cron.

```bash
crontab -e
```

E.g. this cron entry will run it every minute from 7:00 AM to 23:59 PM.

```bash
* 7-23 * * * python /path/to/notifyDoctolibDoctorsAppointment.py
```

## Settings

Adjust those constants to get the most out of your notifications.

### TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

⚠️ The script will abort if you don't provide this data.

⚠️ The script will abort if you don't provide this data.

If you have multiple instances of the script running and share the same Telegram channel it's a good idea to make notifications allocatable.

Type `str|None`.

### UPCOMING_DAYS

Paste the number of days from today, that you want to monitor appointments for, in this constant.

ℹ️ Doctolib has a limit of 15 days.

Type `int`.

Default `15`.

### MAX_DATETIME_IN_FUTURE

If you already have an appointment within the next `UPCOMING_DAYS` you can set this date in this constant so that the script only notifies for **earlier dates**.

E.g.
```python
MAX_DATETIME_IN_FUTURE = datetime(2023, 6, 16, 12, 0, 0)
```

Type `datetime`.

Default `15 days in the future`.

### NOTIFY_HOURLY
